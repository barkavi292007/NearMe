              Thiruvallur is a rapidly developing district and town in Tamil Nadu, near Chennai, known for its rich history, religious significance, and growing industrial importance, home to the ancient Veeraraghava Temple dedicated to Vishnu, attracting pilgrims and visitors to its cultural sites like Poondi Reservoir and Pulicat Lake. 
              The name itself stems from the Tamil phrase "Tiru evvul," referencing Lord Vishnu's sleeping posture, and the town serves as a key administrative hub with a mix of urban and rural characteristics.
